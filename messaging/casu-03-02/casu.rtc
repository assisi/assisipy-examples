# Run-Time Configuration file for Casu 03-02
# Messaging example

# Name of the Casu to connect to
# Casu naming convention is Casu-rr-cc, where rr denotes the row,
# and cc denotes the column where the Casu is located
name     : Casu-03-02

# Address at which the Casu listens for incoming commands
# (i.e., the address to which the controller publishes
# control commands).
# 
# Default value (local simulator and on-Casu deployment):
# tcp://127.0.0.1:5556
pub_addr : tcp://127.0.0.1:5556

# Address to which the Casu publishes sensor data
# (i.e., address from which the controller
# reads sensor data).
#
# Default value (local simulator and on-Casu deployment):
# tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
sub_addr : tcp://127.0.0.1:5555

# Messaging socket address
# This will work for both simulation and deployment
msg_addr : tcp://*:50302
